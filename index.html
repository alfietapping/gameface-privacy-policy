  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 12, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>GameFace processes only one piece of data: a photo you upload. This is used solely to generate your footballer transformation.</p>

  <h2>2. How Your Photo is Used</h2>
  <p>Your image is temporarily sent to two third-party APIs for processing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>OpenAI API</li>
    <li>LightX API</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These services help us perform the transformation effect. The photo is not stored or used for any other purpose.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
  <p>Your photo is never stored. It is deleted immediately after processing.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use OpenAI and LightX. Their privacy policies can be found here:</p>
